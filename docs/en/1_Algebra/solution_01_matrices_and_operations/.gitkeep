EX 1

Question:
For the matrices
A = [ [1, 2],
[3, 4] ]

B = [ [5, 6],
[7, 8] ]

Calculate A + B, AB and A transpose.

Solution:

A + B =
[ [6, 8],
[10, 12] ]

AB =
[ [19, 22],
[43, 50] ]

A transpose =
[ [1, 3],
[2, 4] ]

EX 2

Question:
For the matrix
C =
[ [1, 0, 2],
[-1, 3, 1],
[0, 2, -1] ]

find the transpose.

Solution:

C transpose =
[ [1, -1, 0],
[0, 3, 2],
[2, 1, -1] ]

EX 3

Question:
For the matrix
C =
[ [1, 0, 2],
[-1, 3, 1],
[0, 2, -1] ]

Swap the 1st and 3rd rows, then add twice the new 1st row to the 2nd row.

Solution:

After swapping rows:
[ [0, 2, -1],
[-1, 3, 1],
[1, 0, 2] ]

After row operation (R2 = R2 + 2 * R1):
[ [0, 2, -1],
[-1, 7, -1],
[1, 0, 2] ]

EX 4

Question:
Given the column vectors
u = (1, -2, 3)
v = (2, 0, -1)

Calculate u + v and u - v.

Solution:

u + v = (3, -2, 2)
u - v = (-1, -2, 4)

EX 5

Question:
Calculate the scalar multiplication
2 * [ [1, -1],
[0, 3] ]

Solution:

Result =
[ [2, -2],
[0, 6] ]

---

EX 6

Question:
Check whether the matrix product A (2x3) * B (3x2) is defined.

Solution:

Yes, the multiplication is defined because the number of columns of A equals the number of rows of B.
The result is a 2x2 matrix.

EX 7

Question:
Write the identity matrix and state its property.

Solution:

Identity matrix:
[ [1, 0],
[0, 1] ]

Property:
For any matrix A, A * I = I * A = A.

---

EX 8

Question:
Define the zero matrix.

Solution:

The zero matrix is a matrix where all elements are equal to zero.

Example:
[ [0, 0],
[0, 0] ]

---

EX 9

Question:
Show that matrix addition is commutative.

Solution:

For matrices A and B of the same size:
A + B = B + A

Matrix addition is performed element by element, so the commutative property holds.
