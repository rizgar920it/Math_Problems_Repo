# Interactive Math Notebook

Welcome to the **Math Problems** repository. This project is designated as a comprehensive template for your personal digital notebook, intended to serve you throughout the entire course.

This repository is bilingual (English/Polish) and structured to facilitate the creation of a personalized knowledge base via the Fork & Clone method.

## Workflow and Methodology

To utilize this material effectively, follow the standard procedure:

1.  **Fork this Repository**:
    * Navigate to the source repository: **[https://github.com/dchorazkiewicz/Math_Problems_Repo](https://github.com/dchorazkiewicz/Math_Problems_Repo)**
    * Create your private copy using the `Fork` feature on GitHub.
2.  **Clone Locally**: Download the repository to your local machine.
3.  **Document Solutions**:
    * Navigate through the problem lists (e.g., Algebra, Analysis).
    * For every problem file (e.g., `01_vectors.md`), a corresponding empty directory has been provisioned (e.g., `solution_01_vectors/`).
    * These directories are your **workspaces**. Create Markdown files within them to store your solutions, proofs, and theoretical notes.
4.  **Version Control**: Regularly commit and push your work to your GitHub repository to ensure data persistence.

## The Role of Notes in Exam Preparation

It is crucial to understand the distinction between the learning phase and the verification phase:

* **The Final Exam**: The exam is **written, in-class, and conducted entirely offline**. You will not have access to computers, smartphones, or AI tools during the assessment.
* **The Notebook's Purpose**: The extensive notes you prepare here are your primary study material. You must create them, read them, and understand them deeply *now*, so you can reproduce the logic *later* without technological assistance.

## Leveraging AI for Personalized Learning

We strongly encourage the use of AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) during the semester to prepare your materials. AI allows for the creation of **personalized notes** tailored to your specific needs:

* **Adaptability**: A standard textbook definition might be unclear to you. You can ask AI to "explain this step-by-step" or "provide a geometric intuition," creating a note that matches your learning style.
* **Efficiency**: Do not copy content from the rendered HTML page. Instead, copy the raw Markdown code from the repository into the AI prompt to preserve mathematical formatting.
* **Goal**: The objective is to generate a professional, comprehensive note that serves as a self-study resource.

## Classroom Expectations and Student Responsibility

**All problem lists are available from the first day of the semester.** This allows for advanced preparation.

* **Zero Excuses Policy**: Given the availability of GenAI tools, claiming "I didn't know how to start" or "I couldn't solve it" is not an acceptable justification. A basic solution can be generated in seconds, even on a mobile device while commuting.
* **Focus on Discussion**: Class time is dedicated to discussing solutions, analyzing difficulties, and clarifying doubts—not for solving problems from scratch. You are expected to arrive with prepared materials.
* **Conscientiousness**: Building this repository is an exercise in professional responsibility and managing your work environment.

### For Tech Enthusiasts: GitHub Pages Deployment (Optional)

Students interested in technology may choose to publish their notes as a website using GitHub Pages.

* Use the `mkdocs gh-deploy` command to build and host your notes.
* **Disclaimer**: This is completely optional and does not affect your grade. It is intended solely for self-development.
